One of those big decisions could be buying a house. Here's some information on [buying a house](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/housing) that applies to couples as well as single people.

-   House buying usually involves thousands in [transaction costs](http://www.moolanomy.com/6279/the-cost-of-buying-and-selling-a-home/), so don't keep paying those if you move frequently. As a rule of thumb, buy only when you will stay in the same house for at least [five years](https://www.mortgageloan.com/five-year-rule-and-buying-home-9690). Don't buy just because you don't like paying rent; while rent doesn't build equity, it also avoids maintenance and repair expenses, allows greater location flexibility, and doesn't require a down payment. Early mortgage payments are 75%+ interest, insurance and taxes, and only 25% equity. Property price appreciation is not guaranteed, but if you live somewhere for 20+ years, ownership is almost certain to build wealth over time. Here's a [calculator](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) to do some what-if's.
-   While [mortgage criteria](https://www.capitalone.com/home-loans/mortgage/approval-criteria) vary by lender, you need stable [income history](http://blog.credit.com/2014/07/why-your-job-matters-when-buying-a-home-88105/) (two+ years), a good [credit score](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/how-credit-scores-impact-your-mortgage-rate-1.aspx) (700ish), low [debt to income ratio](https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/debt-to-income-calculator/) (all monthly debt payments below ~35% of gross income), and usually a significant down payment. **One rule of thumb is your house should cost less than three times your annual income.** [Edit: OK, we'll let you have 4X, counting just the mortgage, if you are in a low-property tax state. No Illinois or New Jersey!]
-   There are many types of mortgages. You usually want a [fixed-rate](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/arm-vs-fixed-rate-mortgage-1.aspx) mortgage to lock in current attractive rates in case you stay in your house for many years. A 30-year mortgage might have about a 4% rate; each $100K of mortgage would cost $477/month for principal and interest. With a 15-year mortgage, you'd get a lower rate but higher payments; at 3%, each $100K would be $691/month. The 15-year saves you an enormous amount after 15 years when payments stop; until then, it costs you more out of pocket, as you build equity. It's worth shopping around to get the best rate on a long loan.
-   Principal and interest isn't the only cost. You'll also pay property taxes and insurance, which can add ~20% to these payments, varying by [location](https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-property-taxes/11585/), and could be higher. All condos, most townhouses, and some standalone houses also have monthly [Homeowner Association](http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/helpful-advice/hoa-fees.php) (HOA) fees for maintenance / repairs, that can be several hundred / month. Even with a fixed-rate mortgage, you'll find that taxes, insurance and HOA fees often increase year over year.
-   The gold standard in down payments is 20% of the house price, though many people put down a smaller amount. Some types of mortgages like [VA](https://www.veteransunited.com/va-loans/) and [FHA](https://www.usbank.com/home-loans/mortgage/fha-mortgages.aspx) allow lower down payments, but limited to certain borrowers, or with extra costs. For a conventional mortgage, you will usually pay [Private Mortgage Insurance](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/122/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance.html) (PMI) if you have less than a 20% downpayment. On a typical-size mortgage, this could be $100-200/month. We recommend you save for your downpayment, but gifts from family members are also acceptable to lenders.
-   Adding all that up: that $200k mortgage on a $220K condo isn't just $950 /month for the loan, but also $200 for taxes, $250 for HOA / insurance, and $100 for PMI, so $1500 / month all told.
-   Buying a house often gives you enough deductible interest and property taxes to allow [itemizing deductions](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/homeowner-tax-deductions-29693.html), but only the amount of deductions that exceeds the standard deduction is your net advantage. I.e. if a couple can itemize $20K in deductible interest and taxes (including income tax), they benefit by a net $7400 deduction and save perhaps $1500-2000 in taxes annually.
